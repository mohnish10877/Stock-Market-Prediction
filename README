Predicting how the stock market will perform is one of the most difficult things to do. There are so many factors involved in the prediction – physical factors vs. physiological, rational and irrational behavior, etc. All these aspects combine to make share prices volatile and very difficult to predict with a high degree of accuracy.
Stock market analysis is divided into two parts – Fundamental Analysis and Technical Analysis.
•	Fundamental Analysis involves analyzing the company’s future profitability on the basis of its current business environment and financial performance.
•	Technical Analysis, on the other hand, includes reading the charts and using statistical figures to identify the trends in the stock market.
